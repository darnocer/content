<Callout text="My Kindle is probably just old at this point, but I have the hardest time getting my Notes & Highlights to sync so I can access them from my laptop. If you are also struggling to access your notes and highlights from anywhere other than your Kindle device, this tip is for you." />

`Device: Kindle Paperwhite 7th Generation`

## Troubleshooting Syncing Issues

First thing's first... make sure you've done all of these steps:
- [ ] Ensure both devices are connected to the same Wifi
- [ ] Ensure both devices are connected to the same Amazon account
- [ ] Ensure *Whispersync* is enabled:
	1. Go to [Manage Your Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mycd)
	2. Select the **Preferences** tab
	3. Select **Device Synchronization (Whispersync Settings)** and confirm that the feature is turned **ON**
- [ ] Try to `🔄 Sync` from both devices
- [ ] Disconnect/reconnect account from Kindle App for Mac
- [ ] Disconnect/reconnect account from Kindle device
  - ⚠️ Warning: This caused all of my highlights to disappear from my Kindle device :( However, they were recovered in one of the below methods. 

✅ Your sync was successful if the notes & highlights appear in the [web browser notebook here](https://read.amazon.com/notebook)

## Exporting Highlights

### Method 1: Export from Web Notebook

_If you've successfully synced your notebook, you can export the highlights as an HTML file with this method, which can be pasted into Obsidian or your note-taking app_. 

Once you are able to see the highlights synced to the web browser notebook [here](https://read.amazon.com/notebook):
1. Select the book whose highlights you want to export
2. On one of the highlights, select the **Options** dropdown > **Open in Kindle** (This should load all of the synced highlights for the book into the Kindle app)
3. From the *Notes & Highlights* sidebar in the app, click **Export**
4. Click **Save As** > save the document

### Method 2: Export .txt File

_If you're unable to sync your notebook, you can access a text file with all of your book highlights. It is kind of last resort as it's not the best format._

1. Plug Kindle into Mac _(note: I needed to use a USB-C cable for my Mac as my device was not recognized when using a USC-C adapter. Using a micro-USB adapter for the Kindle device worked, though.)_
2. Locate the Device in Finder
3. Go to **Documents**
4. Locate `My Clippings.txt`


### Method 3: Readwise.io (recommended)

In my case, syncing to the web notebook was unreliable— I would go through all of the troubleshooting steps, and sometimes they wouldn't appear for months. Grabbing them from the .txt file kind of sucks. I read a lot and love to revisit notes for insights, so I needed a better way. At one point, I tried de-registering/re-registering my Kindle device in an effort to get them to sync, and all of my highlights disappeared! I was devastated. 

I thought all hope was lost, until I found [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) (this reads like an ad, but I swear it's not). With their free trial, I was able to recover all of my lost highlights from the ether and effortlessly sync them to Obsidian. Now, I just have Readwise bring my notes over automatically. It's well worth the subscription fee.
