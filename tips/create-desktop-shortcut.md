1. Go to the website you want to save as a shortcut
2. Click the Settings icon in the top right corner (3 lines or dots, depending on your browser)
3. Go to **More Tools...** > **Create Shortcut** 
4. Name the app (eg. "Gmail") and check open as a new window (if you want it to open as a separate app window rather than a browser tab)
5. On the app icon in the dock: right-click > **Options** > **Keep in Dock**
