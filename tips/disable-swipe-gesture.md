<Callout text="A two-finger swipe from left-to-right is the gesture to go 'back' in your web browser. I love quick gestures and hot keys, but this one screwed me over more times than it was helpful by accidentally triggering it."/>
This disables the gesture in Chrome: 

1. On MacOS, open **Terminal**
2. Enter the command:
```bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE
```
3. Restart Browser
